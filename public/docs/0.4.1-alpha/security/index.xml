      <description>Kerberos Ozone depends on Kerberos to make the clusters secure. Historically, HDFS has supported running in an isolated secure networks where it is possible to deploy without securing the cluster.
This release of Ozone follows that model, but soon will move to secure by default. Today to enable security in ozone cluster, we need to set the configuration ozone.security.enabled to true and hadoop.security.authentication to kerberos.
   Property Value     ozone.</description>

      <description>Datanodes under Hadoop is traditionally secured by creating a Keytab file on the data nodes. With Ozone, we have moved away to using data node certificates. That is, Kerberos on data nodes is not needed in case of a secure Ozone cluster.
However, we support the legacy Kerberos based Authentication to make it easy for the current set of users.The HDFS configuration keys are the following that is setup in hdfs-site.</description>

      <description>Ozone TDE setup process and usage are very similar to HDFS TDE. The major difference is that Ozone TDE is enabled at Ozone bucket level when a bucket is created.
Setting up the Key Management Server To use TDE, clients must setup a Key Management Server and provide that URI to Ozone/HDFS. Since Ozone and HDFS can use the same Key Management Server, this configuration can be provided via hdfs-site.</description>

      <title>Securing S3</title>

      <description>To access an S3 bucket, users need AWS access key ID and AWS secret. Both of these are generated by going to AWS website. When you use Ozone&amp;rsquo;s S3 protocol, you need the same AWS access key and secret.
Under Ozone, the clients can download the access key directly from Ozone. The user needs to kinit first and once they have authenticated via kerberos they can download the S3 access key ID and AWS secret.</description>

      <description>Apache Rangerâ„¢ is a framework to enable, monitor and manage comprehensive data security across the Hadoop platform. Any version of Apache Ranger which is greater than 1.20 is aware of Ozone, and can manage an Ozone cluster.
To use Apache Ranger, you must have Apache Ranger installed in your Hadoop Cluster. For installation instructions of Apache Ranger, Please take a look at the Apache Ranger website.
If you have a working Apache Ranger installation that is aware of Ozone, then configuring Ozone to work with Apache Ranger is trivial.</description>

      <title>Ozone ACLs</title>

      <guid>/security/securityacls.html</guid>
      <description>Ozone supports a set of native ACLs. These ACLs can be used independently or along with Ranger. If Apache Ranger is enabled, then ACL will be checked first with Ranger and then Ozone&amp;rsquo;s internal ACLs will be evaluated.
Ozone ACLs are a super set of Posix and S3 ACLs.
The general format of an ACL is object:who:rights.
Where an object can be:
 Volume - An Ozone volume. e.g. /volume Bucket - An Ozone bucket.</description>
